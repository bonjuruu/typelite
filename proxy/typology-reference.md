# Typology Cross-System Reference

Use this reference to write accurate cross-system analyses. NEVER repeat these descriptions verbatim — synthesize and apply them to the specific type combination.

## Attitudinal Psyche — Position Dynamics

The positions are not just rankings — they shape HOW a person relates to each domain:
- **1st**: Confident to the point of arrogance. Doesn't question their approach. Dismisses others' opinions in this area. Imposes their view. Not collaborative here — they just do it.
- **2nd**: Genuinely enjoys engaging with this area. Flexible, creative, open to dialogue. This is where they're most collaborative and adaptive. Their comfort zone for growth.
- **3rd**: The wound. Deeply insecure, hypersensitive to criticism, oscillates between overcompensating and withdrawing. They care intensely but feel fundamentally inadequate. This is where they're most volatile.
- **4th**: Genuinely doesn't care. Not suppressed — truly indifferent. Defers to others without anxiety. This area doesn't register as important to their identity.

### Cross-system implications of each position:
- 1st aspect + corresponding enneagram motivation = doubled intensity, potential rigidity
- 3rd aspect + enneagram core fear touching the same domain = amplified insecurity, defensive spirals
- 4th aspect + MBTI inferior function in the same domain = total blind spot, but no distress about it
- 2nd aspect + MBTI hero function = natural flow, the person at their best
- 3rd aspect + MBTI hero function = tension — they're skilled but never feel good enough

### Aspect-to-domain mapping:
- Volition (V): Direction, willpower, agency, decision-making, knowing what you want
- Logic (L): Analysis, systems thinking, truth, correctness, intellectual framework
- Emotion (E): Feelings, aesthetics, self-expression, emotional connection, empathy
- Physics (F): Body, material world, comfort, health, sensory experience, practical action

## Enneagram — Core Dynamics

### Valid wings (MUST be adjacent):
1w9, 1w2, 2w1, 2w3, 3w2, 3w4, 4w3, 4w5, 5w4, 5w6, 6w5, 6w7, 7w6, 7w8, 8w7, 8w9, 9w8, 9w1

### Type essences (what drives them, not what they do):
- **1**: Driven by integrity. Fears being corrupt/wrong. Internal critic never stops. Wing toward 9 = more idealistic, withdrawn. Wing toward 2 = more interpersonal, critical of others.
- **2**: Driven by being needed. Fears being unwanted. Gives to get. Wing toward 1 = more principled giving. Wing toward 3 = more image-conscious giving.
- **3**: Driven by achievement. Fears being worthless without accomplishments. Shapeshifts to succeed. Wing toward 2 = warmer performer. Wing toward 4 = more introspective achiever.
- **4**: Driven by identity/authenticity. Fears having no personal significance. Feels fundamentally different. Wing toward 3 = more ambitious, outward. Wing toward 5 = more withdrawn, cerebral.
- **5**: Driven by understanding. Fears being helpless/incompetent. Hoards energy and knowledge. Wing toward 4 = more emotionally intense, idiosyncratic. Wing toward 6 = more loyal, systematic.
- **6**: Driven by security. Fears being without guidance/support. Tests loyalties, anticipates threats. Wing toward 5 = more withdrawn, cerebral. Wing toward 7 = more outgoing, counterphobic.
- **7**: Driven by freedom/stimulation. Fears being trapped in pain. Reframes, plans, avoids depth. Wing toward 6 = more anxious, loyal. Wing toward 8 = more assertive, intense.
- **8**: Driven by control/autonomy. Fears being controlled/vulnerable. Confronts, protects, dominates. Wing toward 7 = more scattered, adventurous. Wing toward 9 = more steady, protective.
- **9**: Driven by peace/harmony. Fears loss of connection, conflict. Merges with others, numbs out. Wing toward 8 = more assertive, stubborn. Wing toward 1 = more principled, critical.

### Integration/disintegration lines:
- 1↔7, 2↔4, 3↔6, 4↔1, 5↔8, 6↔9, 7↔5, 8↔2, 9↔3
- Integration (growth): The type moves toward the healthy qualities of their integration point
- Disintegration (stress): The type takes on the unhealthy qualities of their stress point

### Instinctual variants:
- **sp (self-preservation)**: Focus on security, comfort, health, resources, material well-being. Grounds the type in practical concerns.
- **so (social)**: Focus on belonging, status, group dynamics, reading social hierarchies. Orients the type outward.
- **sx (sexual/1-to-1)**: Focus on intensity, chemistry, merging, attraction, depth of connection. Makes the type more volatile and passionate.

The variant RESHAPES the type: sp-5 looks very different from sx-5 (hoarding resources vs hoarding intensity).

## MBTI — Cognitive Function Dynamics

### Function essences:
- **Ti**: Internal logical framework. Builds precise models. Seeks truth independent of consensus.
- **Te**: External efficiency. Organizes, delegates, measures. Seeks what works.
- **Fi**: Internal value system. Authentic emotional compass. Knows what matters to them deeply.
- **Fe**: External harmony. Reads and manages group emotions. Seeks interpersonal connection.
- **Si**: Internal sensory recall. Compares present to past experience. Seeks stability and continuity.
- **Se**: External sensory engagement. Present-moment awareness. Seeks direct experience.
- **Ni**: Internal pattern convergence. Sees where things are heading. Seeks singular insight.
- **Ne**: External pattern divergence. Sees possibilities and connections. Seeks novelty and alternatives.

### Beebe slot dynamics:
- **Hero**: Natural, effortless, dominant. Can be overused. The person identifies with this function.
- **Parent**: Responsible, nurturing, supportive. Used to help others. More measured than Hero.
- **Child**: Playful, immature, delightful but unreliable. Source of joy and vulnerability. Can be naive.
- **Inferior**: Aspirational but clumsy. Source of deep insecurity AND growth. Under stress it erupts crudely. It's what the person secretly wants to develop.

### Key dynamics:
- Hero-Inferior axis is the core tension: Ti-Hero/Fe-Inferior = precise logic but clumsy with group emotions
- The Inferior function often connects to the enneagram's core wound when they touch the same domain
- Hero function in 2nd AP position = effortless mastery. Hero function in 3rd AP position = skilled but insecure about it.

## Socionics — Quadra and Type Dynamics

### Quadra values (what the quadra considers important):
- **Alpha** (ILE, SEI, ESE, LII): Values Ne+Si and Fe+Ti. Warmth, curiosity, playfulness, shared understanding. Democratic atmosphere. Comfortable discussing ideas and feelings openly.
- **Beta** (SLE, IEI, EIE, LSI): Values Se+Ni and Fe+Ti. Intensity, vision, willpower, emotional force. Hierarchical. Drawn to power, drama, and grand narratives.
- **Gamma** (SEE, ILI, LIE, ESI): Values Se+Ni and Te+Fi. Pragmatism, results, personal loyalty, individual achievement. Competitive. Values efficiency and authentic relationships over group harmony.
- **Delta** (IEE, SLI, LSE, EII): Values Ne+Si and Te+Fi. Practicality, personal ethics, comfort, quiet reliability. Egalitarian. Values competence and genuine care over drama.

### Type-specific notes (how the type relates to its quadra):
- **LII**: Leads with Ti. Analytical and systematic. Expresses Alpha's warmth on their own terms — through careful engagement with ideas rather than emotional expressiveness. Values Fe but accesses it through their logical framework.
- **ILE**: Leads with Ne. Curious, generative, quick to explore. Embodies Alpha's openness to possibility.
- **ESE**: Leads with Fe. Socially attuned, expressive, energizing. Alpha's emotional connector.
- **SEI**: Leads with Si. Comfort-oriented, gentle, attentive to sensory needs. Alpha's grounding presence.
- **EIE**: Leads with Fe. Emotionally intense, narratively driven, inspiring. Channels Beta's passion through vision and feeling.
- **LSI**: Leads with Ti. Structured, disciplined, methodical. Provides Beta's organizational backbone — logic in service of the group's intensity.
- **SLE**: Leads with Se. Forceful, direct, action-oriented. Beta's mobilizer.
- **IEI**: Leads with Ni. Contemplative, future-oriented, attuned to undercurrents. Holds Beta's vision — receptive where the quadra is often assertive.
- **LIE**: Leads with Te. Efficient, goal-oriented, pragmatic. Gamma's driver — moves toward results.
- **ESI**: Leads with Fi. Loyal, principled, discerning about who they trust. Gamma's moral anchor.
- **ILI**: Leads with Ni. Strategic, measured, anticipatory. Gamma's long-view thinker — cautious where others charge ahead.
- **SEE**: Leads with Se. Bold, charismatic, present-focused. Gamma's initiator.
- **EII**: Leads with Fi. Deeply empathic, values-driven, idealistic. Delta's ethical center.
- **LSE**: Leads with Te. Organized, dependable, industrious. Delta's structural backbone.
- **SLI**: Leads with Si. Methodical, comfort-aware, quietly skilled. Delta's craftsperson.
- **IEE**: Leads with Ne. Enthusiastic, interpersonally perceptive, possibility-oriented. Delta's catalyst.

### Cross-system note:
MBTI and Socionics types do NOT map 1-to-1. INTP ≠ LII (despite superficial similarity). Treat them as independent systems that may agree or create friction.

## Expanded Instincts — Center Dynamics

### Centers (what drives the person's sense of aliveness):
- **Self-Survival (SUR)**: Aliveness through self-reliance, physical mastery, personal fortitude. These people feel most alive when they can handle things themselves.
- **Interpersonal (INT)**: Aliveness through connection, transformation, shared experience. These people feel most alive in relationship.
- **Purpose (PUR)**: Aliveness through meaning, significance, legacy. These people feel most alive when pursuing something larger than themselves.

### Realms:
- **FD (Fortitude)** [SUR]: Endurance, resilience, pushing through
- **SY (Security)** [SUR]: Safety, stability, resource management
- **SM (Self-Management)** [SUR]: Discipline, routine, self-regulation
- **AY (Alchemy)** [INT]: Transformation, chemistry, mutual change
- **CY (Community)** [INT]: Belonging, contribution, social fabric
- **BG (Bonding)** [INT]: Attachment, intimacy, deep connection
- **SS (Self-Significance)** [PUR]: Identity, distinction, personal meaning
- **EX (Existentialism)** [PUR]: Mortality, truth, confronting reality
- **UN (Unknown)** [PUR]: Mystery, exploration, venturing beyond

### Cross-system dynamics:
- SUR center + sp enneagram variant = massive reinforcement of self-reliance orientation
- INT center + sx enneagram variant = doubled intensity in relationships
- PUR center + so enneagram variant = interesting tension — purpose-driven but socially oriented
- SUR center + 3rd Physics = contradiction — drawn to self-reliance but insecure about physical competence
- PUR center + 4th Volition = tension — seeking significance but indifferent to personal direction
